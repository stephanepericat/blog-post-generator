    "**COVID‑19: The Capitalist Crisis Unfolds in Vascular Aging, New Variants, Legal Battles and Pandemic‑Era Scams**  \nby the editorial board of That Covid Life  \n\n---\n\n### Introduction – The Pandemic as a Class Test  \n\nThe latest wave of COVID‑19 news is a stark reminder that the virus is not merely a medical emergency but a structural wound inflicted on the working class by the contradictions of late‑stage capitalism. From scientific studies that reveal a gender‑biased acceleration of vascular aging to a new “Stratus” variant sweeping the United States, from surging hospitalizations in Maryland and Washington to court rulings that turn pandemic‑related losses into profit opportunities, each headline exposes how profit‑driven institutions weaponize the pandemic against ordinary people. In the following analysis we will synthesize the recent reports that dominate the media, expose the class forces behind them, and show how these events are inseparable from the broader crisis of imperialist capitalism.\n\n---\n\n### 1. Vascular Aging – A Hidden Burden That Falls Heavier on Women  \n\nA multinational study reported in *New Scientist* shows that COVID‑19 “seems to accelerate the ageing of blood vessels, but perhaps only among women” ([source](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2492805-covid-19-seems-to-age-blood-vessels-but-only-among-women/)). Researchers measured arterial stiffness in three patient groups—including those with mild disease—and found that women who had been infected displayed vessels that were up to five years “older” than those of uninfected peers. Hospitalised women showed an even larger gap, with a vascular age about five years older, rising to 7.5 years for those in intensive care. The authors argue that this vascular ageing may help explain why “long‑COVID” is more prevalent among women, a condition that still lacks adequate social safety nets for those who cannot return to work.\n\nFrom a Marxist perspective the gendered impact of this finding is not accidental. Women constitute a disproportionate share of low‑wage service jobs—retail, caregiving, hospitality—where exposure to the virus is higher and protective equipment is scarce. The capitalist health‑care system, which treats the body as a commodity, externalises the long‑term cost of such damage onto the workers themselves, while pharmaceutical firms reap the profits of acute‑care treatments. The study’s warning that “stiffer arteries increase the risk of cardiovascular disease, including stroke and heart attacks” is, in effect, a capitalist indictment: the system forces women to bear the physiological consequences of a virus that it permitted to spread unchecked among the working class.\n\n---\n\n### 2. The “Stratus” Variant – Capitalist Negligence Meets Viral Evolution  \n\nThe United States is now confronting a new, highly transmissible COVID‑19 strain known as XFG—or “Stratus”—which the *TODAY* network describes as “driving the late‑summer wave” across the nation ([source](https://www.today.com/health/coronavirus/stratus-covid-variant-symptoms-rcna224723)). CDC data show emergency‑department visits rising for all ages, with a noticeable uptick among children under twelve. Health officials note that the variant carries “several unique mutations … that improve the virus's ability to evade antibodies from prior infection or vaccination” ([source](https://www.today.com/health/coronavirus/stratus-covid-variant-symptoms-rcna224723)).  \n\nThe emergence of Stratus is not a natural disaster divorced from economics. It is the direct product of a global capitalist system that privileges corporate profit over public health, accelerating viral mutation through unequal vaccine distribution and a health‑care market that incentivises short‑term “boosters” rather than universal, freely available prophylaxis. The profit motive fuels a “race” to develop variant‑specific shots, while the working class is left to shoulder the cost of repeated infections, lost wages, and the ever‑looming threat of long‑COVID.  \n\n---\n\n### 3. State‑Level Surges: Maryland, Washington, and the Nationwide Upward Trend  \n\nRegional data confirm that the virus is not retreating. *MedicalXpress* reports a 123 % jump in COVID‑19 hospitalisations in Maryland over the past two weeks—the highest monthly total since April—while wastewater monitoring shows a “very high” viral load in Montgomery County and Anne Arundel ([source](https://medicalxpress.com/news/2025-08-covid-cases-surge-maryland-summer.html)). The same outlet notes that “COVID‑19 hospitalizations have historically followed a seasonal pattern, but the current surge arrives later than usual, driven by the Stratus variant.”  \n\nIn the Pacific Northwest, *Axios* points out that Washington is “among a dozen states with the highest COVID‑19 cases right now,” with the CDC labeling the national trend as “growing” in 45 states ([source](https://www.axios.com/local/seattle/2025/08/18/washington-covid-19-stratus-variant-cases-surge)). The CDC’s recent data show a nationwide positivity rate of 9 % in early August, surpassing the post‑holiday surge of January, though still below last year’s peak of 18 %.  \n\nThese spikes expose a two‑fold class contradiction. First, capitalist health‑care infrastructure is ill‑equipped to address surges because it is organized around profit, not prevention; hospitals are reimbursed for treating the sick, not for keeping populations healthy. Second, state responses are hamstrung by the neoliberal agenda that favours deregulation and cuts to public health funding, forcing the working class to confront rising infection rates with minimal protective resources. The surge in school districts—illustrated by the *Colorado Politics* report of rising emergency‑department visits as students return to school ([source](https://www.coloradopolitics.com/2025/08/18/covid-19-cases-rise-as-students-return-to-school-in-denver/))—further demonstrates how capitalist imperatives to keep education “open” clash with the need for adequate health safeguards, thereby endangering students and teachers alike.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Legal Battles Over Pandemic Losses – Turning Crisis Into Profit  \n\nCapitalism thrives on turning disaster into profit, a fact underscored by two recent court cases. In Minnesota, an appeals court ruled that insurance claims tied to health‑club closures during the pandemic may be treated as “multiple occurrences” rather than a single event, potentially inflating insurer payouts ([source](https://www.insurancebusinessmag.com/us/news/legal-insights/minnesota-appeals-court-makes-covid19-case-ruling-546488.aspx)). The decision underscores how insurance companies, despite their ostensible role as “risk‑mitigators,” leverage the pandemic to widen profit margins while policyholders—often small‑business owners and workers—are left to navigate a labyrinth of legal definitions to receive compensation.  \n\nA far more nefarious example of profit‑driven exploitation is the *WKRG* exposé on a Pensacola company that marketed an unregistered pesticide as a COVID‑19 cure, in clear violation of federal insecticide law ([source](https://www.wkrg.com/northwest-florida/escambia-county/pensacola-company-sentenced-for-covid-19-pesticide-scheme/)). The firm conspired to distribute the chemical between March and December 2020, exploiting the public’s fear during the height of the pandemic to enrich itself. The U.S. Attorney described the scheme as “exploiting the COVID‑19 pandemic to enrich itself through deceptive distribution of a chemical agent that had not been registered or approved for use on humans.”  \n\nBoth cases illustrate how the pandemic’s chaos is harnessed by capitalist actors—insurers seeking higher payouts, and opportunistic entrepreneurs peddling bogus cures—to deepen exploitation of the working class. The legal system, far from protecting the masses, becomes a battlefield where corporate interests dictate the terms of disaster relief.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Vaccine Policy Under the Shadow of a Populist Anti‑Vaccine Minister  \n\nThe vaccine landscape has also been reshaped by a new political agenda. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a long‑time anti‑vaccine activist, has “upended the way COVID‑19 vaccines are approved and for whom they’re recommended,” creating confusion where coverage was once routine ([source](https://www.dailybreeze.com/2025/08/18/senior-living-sorting-out-covid-19-vaccine-confusion-amid-new-conflicting-federal-policies/)). The *Daily Breeze* notes that the FDA’s full approval of Moderna’s Spikevax is limited to adults 65 and older, while for younger people it remains “restricted to those at increased risk”—a decision that hinges on a federal advisory panel yet to vote on recommendations for the upcoming fall season.  \n\nThe article also cites that “Kennedy’s recommendation that healthy children not get vaccinated” hinges on a “shared clinical decision‑making” model, leaving families uncertain about coverage and cost‑sharing. This policy volatility feeds directly into the capitalist health‑care system, where insurance companies and pharmaceutical firms profit from the ambiguity—they can charge higher premiums for “optional” shots while shifting the responsibility for health onto individuals. For working‑class families already burdened by precarious employment, the resulting confusion translates into a higher risk of infection, missed work, and medical debt.\n\n---\n\n### 6. The Bigger Picture – Imperialism, Profit, and the Pandemic  \n\nAll these strands—gendered vascular aging, a rapidly mutating virus, regional surges, legal profiteering, and politicised vaccine policy—are manifestations of a single underlying dynamic: capitalism’s relentless drive for profit even amidst a global health crisis. Imperialist extraction compounds the problem, as supply‑chain disruptions, underfunded public health infrastructure, and the commodification of scientific research all serve to keep the working class in a perpetual state of vulnerability. The pandemic has revealed, once again, that the health of the many is subordinated to the wealth of the few.\n\nThe scientific evidence that COVID‑19 can add “up to five years” of vascular age to women’s bodies is a micro‑cosm of the broader reality: the virus is a tool of capitalist oppression that extracts a hidden, long‑term cost from those already oppressed by gender and class hierarchies. The emergence of the Stratus variant is the biological echo of a system that forces workers to live and work in unsafe conditions, thereby accelerating viral evolution. State‑level surges and the lack of robust public‑health responses are the result of austerity policies that have hollowed out the very institutions that could protect the masses. Meanwhile, courts and scammers turn disaster into profit, illustrating Marx’s law that “capitalism makes the poor, and poverty makes capitalism.”\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion – Toward a Socialist Remedy  \n\nThe pandemic is not a natural disaster that will simply “run its course”; it is a crisis generated and perpetuated by capitalist exploitation. The working class must recognize that each new study, each variant, and each legal decision is a symptom of a system that privileges profit over life. The path forward is clear: a democratic, socialist transformation of health care, wherein medical research, vaccine production, and public‑health infrastructure are socialised and operated under democratic control. Only through the overthrow of the profit motive in health can we guarantee universal access to preventive care, eliminate gender‑biased health harms, and prevent opportunists from weaponising crisis for enrichment.  \n\nThe international working class must seize this moment—still reeling from the pandemic’s hidden toll—to demand a socialist health system that treats every body as a collective good, not a market commodity. The fight for Trotskyism, with its emphasis on permanent revolution and the unbroken alliance of workers across borders, provides the revolutionary framework needed to dismantle the capitalist structures that have turned COVID‑19 into a tool of oppression. Let the lessons of vascular aging, viral mutation, and legal scams galvanize us toward a future where health is a right, not a profit, and where the next pandemic—if it ever returns—finds a world built on solidarity, not exploitation.",
